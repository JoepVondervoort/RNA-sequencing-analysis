# RNA-sequencing-analysis
RNA seq analyis for two feature count tables combined

## Overview

Welcome to the RNA-Seq Analysis Toolkit, a versatile R-based toolset for performing comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis on two separate feature count files. This toolkit utilizes DESEQ2 for differential gene expression analysis, generates Volcano plots to visualize significant gene changes, and conducts gene ontology analysis to gain insights into biological functions.

## Features

- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Utilizes DESEQ2, a powerful R package, to perform differential gene expression analysis on two feature count files, identifying genes that are significantly upregulated or downregulated.

- **Interactive Volcano Plots**: Generate visually appealing Volcano plots that allow you to easily identify and visualize the most significant gene expression changes in your data.

- **Gene Ontology Analysis**: Gain deeper biological insights by conducting gene ontology analysis to uncover the enriched functional categories among differentially expressed genes.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the RNA-Seq Analysis Toolkit:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have R and DESEQ2 installed on your system.
3. Prepare your feature count files and place them in the designated input directory.
4. Run the R script, providing the necessary input parameters.
5. Explore the generated results, including DESEQ2 output, Volcano plots, and gene ontology analysis results.

## Dependencies

- R (with DESEQ2 installed)
